# Objectives
* Increase speaker, panel, and workshop diversity at conferences

## Reasons for objectives
* The ratios of straight, cis, white men to people of color, women, queers, and otherwise underrepresented people leaves me wanting
* The usual suspects are awesome, but attendees can watch them speak at almost every other conference

Double blind CFPs are effective at finding talks with merit within a pool of speakers who submit CFPs. However, this process selects for people who know the conference is happening and CFPs are open and people who are comfortable submitting a talk with no prompting. It fails to increase diversity because the pool doesn't represent actual diversity in tech.

# An Invitation Based Process
* Personally invite 80% of the lineup until there is a ratio of humans that meets your diversity goals
* To locate first time speakers outside of your personal network, open blind CFPs to solicit speakers for the remaining 20%
* In order for speakers selected for the first 80% of the lineup, they must introduce organizers to someone interested in giving – and able to give – an amazing talk on the subject of the conference.

There is major risks in this approach. For instance, if I end up with a lineup of 100% white men, I have no mechanism to point to but myself. I can't blame a blind selection process. To mitigate this, I've introduced one more mechanism to the process.
